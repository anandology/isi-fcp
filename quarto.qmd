# Publishing with Quarto

[Quarto][] is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. It makes it easier to publish articles, books and websites for techincal content.

[Quarto]: https://quarto.org/

### Installation

Install Quarto.

```txt
$ wget https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/download/v1.5.57/quarto-1.5.57-linux-amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i quarto-1.5.57-linux-amd64.deb
```

Install `librsvg2-bin` package to work with svg.

```txt
$ sudo apt install librsvg2-bin
```

Install Latex.

```txt
$ sudo quarto install tinytex
```

## Getting Started

Quarto .qmd files contain a combination of markdown and executable code cells. For the scope of this article, we'll limit ourselves to Markdown.

Create a file with name `demo.qmd` with the following content.

::: {.demo-source .sourceCode}

    # Quarto Demo

    This is a demonstration of authoring articles with [Quarto](https://quarto.qmd).

    ## A Bit of Math

    Markdown supports embedding LaTeX for writing mathematics.

    For example, the area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\pi r^2$.

    And:

    $\Sigma_{x=1}^{n}{x} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

    ## The Circle

    Here is a sample C program using [csketch](https://gitub.com/anandology/csketch) library.

    ```c
    #include <sketch.h>

    int main()
    {
        // draw a circle with center as (0, 0) and radius 100
        draw_circle(0, 0, 100);

        // save all the shapes draws to lesson2.svg
        save_sketch("circle.svg");
    }
    ```

    And that generates a `circle.svg` with the following image.

    ![](circle.svg)

Now convert this to HTML by running:

```text
$ quarto render demo.qmd --to html
...

Output created: demo.html
```

Open `demo.html` in your browser to see the output.

You can also convert this to PDF by running:

```txt
$ quarto render demo.qmd --to pdf
...

Output created: demo.pdf
```

You can open `demo.pdf` to see how it looks like.

## Creating a book

You can create a book using Quarto to publish the solutions to problem sets.

### Step 1: Create a github repository

Create a new github repository. You may call it `fcp-practice` or `programming-practice` or something else.

### Step 2: Clone the repo on your computer

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>

$ cd <repo-name>
```

### Step 3: Create a quarto project

Run command `quarto create`.

```text
$ quarto create
 ? Create
 ❯ project
   extension

   confluence
```

Select _book_ and press `Enter`.

```text
$ quarto create
 ? Create › project
 ? Type › book
 ? Directory › .
```

Enter `.` for directory and press `Enter`.

```text
$ quarto create
 ? Create › project

 ? Directory › .
Creating project at /tmp/quarto2:
  - Created _quarto.yml
  - Created index.qmd
  - Created intro.qmd
  - Created summary.qmd
  - Created references.qmd
  - Created cover.png
  - Created references.bib
 ? Open With
 ❯ vscode
