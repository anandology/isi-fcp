## Setting up Git


Setup git by configuring your name and email address in git.

```text
$ git config --global user.name "Anand Chitipothu"
$ git config --global user.email "anand@example.com"
```

Please use your name and email address in the example above. Also, make sure the email address is same as what you have used when creating an account on github.

## Setup ssh-keys

```text
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C anand@my-laptop-name
```

That will output the following:

```text
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/anand/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```

Just press _Enter_.

```text
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```

If you are using your own laptop, leave this empty. If you using the lab computer, pick a strong passphrase as that allows pusing any changes to your repositories on github.
