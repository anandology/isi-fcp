# Introduction to Git

Git is a popular version control system used to keep track of changes to various files.

## Setting up Git


Setup git by configuring your name and email address in git.

```text
$ git config --global user.name "Anand Chitipothu"
$ git config --global user.email "anand@example.com"
```

Please use your name and email address in the example above. Also, make sure the email address is same as what you have used when creating an account on github.

## Setup ssh-keys

```text
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C anand@my-laptop-name
```

That will output the following:

```text
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/anand/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```

Just press _Enter_.

```text
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```

If you are using your own laptop, leave this empty. If you using the lab computer, pick a strong passphrase as that allows pusing any changes to your repositories on github.

## Git Usage Complexity

### Level 1

Use git for managing your own projects.

### Level 2

Use git to collaborate with a small number of known people.

### Level 3

Collaborate with unknown, untrusted people.

## Cloning a Repository

Run these steps after creating your repository and adding your ssh-keys.

```text
$ cd
$ pwd
/home/anand
$
$ git clone git@github.com:anandology/git-practice.git
Cloning into 'git-practice'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (4/4), done.
$ cd git-practice/
$ code .
```

Replace the repository URL in the example with the URL of your repoistory clone URL.
