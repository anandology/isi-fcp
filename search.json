Please install it from Visual Studio Code Downloads page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you are on Ubuntu 18.04, please install an older version by running the following commands.\nwget https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.75.1/linux-deb-x64/stable\nsudo dpkg -i code_1.75.1-1675893397_amd64.deb\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the following instructions to install SVG Extension to preview SVG files directly in vscode.

For this we are going to use the command grep to match lines in a file that match given Regular Expression pattern.\nThe file /usr/share/dict/words contains all the words in the dictionary, one in each line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you don’t find that file, it means you don’t have a dictionary installed. Install it by running:\n$ sudo apt-get -y install wbritish\n\n\n$ wc -l /usr/share/dict/words\n104334 /usr/share/dict/words\nLet’s try to find all words that start with a prefix, say ice.\n$ grep '^ice' /usr/share/dict/words\nice\niceberg\niceberg's\nicebergs\nicebound\nicebox\niceboxes\nicebox's\nicebreaker\nicebreaker's\nicebreakers\nicecap\nicecap's\nicecaps\niced\nice's\nices\nLet’s find all the 5 letter words in the dictionary.\n$ grep '^.....$' /usr/share/dict/words | head\nABC's\nABM's\nAFAIK\nAFC's\nAMD's\nANSIs\nANZUS\nAOL's\nASCII\nASL's\n$ grep '^.....$' /usr/share/dict/words | wc -l\n7044\nThere are quite many of them.

Ok, FLAME!\n\n\n\nHow many 5-letter words are there that have letter f in them?\n$ grep '^.....$' /usr/share/dict/words | grep f | wc -l\n469\nThe letter L, A, M and E are not present in our word. Let’s try to skip all the words that have any of these characters.\n$ grep '^.....$' /usr/share/dict/words | grep f | grep -v '[lame]' | wc -l\n123\nThat is still quite a lof of them.

I’ll go with Swift.\n\n\n\nNow that we know correct letters in three positions and 6 letters that are not present, let’s see what all words are available.\n$ grep '^s.if.$' /usr/share/dict/words |  grep -v '[lamewt]' | head\nskiff\nsniff\n$ grep '^s.if.$' /usr/share/dict/words |  grep -v '[lamewt]'\nskiff\nsniff\nLet’s try with the first one skiff.\n\n\n\nYay!

    "text": "The primary mode of interacting with a unix system is using the command line. While it may look like using a graphical user interface is lot easier to use, it is not usually optimal in most of the cases. While the command-line interface may have steeper learning curve, the ability to automate things easily pays off the effort very quickly.\nLet me recall the quote that we have discussed from SICP.\n\nEvery powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:\n\nprimitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,\nmeans of combination, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and\nmeans of abstraction, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.\n\n\n– Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\nConsider the task of creating a mp4 video from frame images generated by your C program, like some of you have done. It requires running the program, converting each of the SVG image generated by the program into png and combining all of them together to make it into a video.\nThe typical way of doing this using a graphical user interface would really cumbersome. That may involve doing something like this:\n\nRun your program\nOpen the image converter program, select an svg file and press a button to convert it to png and repeat it for each one of the images\nOpen the video maker program, select all the png files that need to be included, press a button to make the video\n\nIt is really tedious to do this again and again. If we look this in the lens SICP, the primitive expressions of this system are your program, image converter and video maker. The only way to combine them is by doing each one of them one after the other and there is no way to abstrat them, give it a name and use like a single operation.\nWhen you think of command line, you can take combine the primitive commands by running them one after the other, but you can also abstract them and give it a name by making a script and running just that script.\nIn this lesson, we’ll learn the how command-line interface works and how to use it effectively.\n\n\nPlease install the required packages to install the commands used in this lesson.\n$ sudo apt-get -y install coreutils figlet cowsay wbritish\n\n\n\nLet’s start with priting a hello message.\nOpen your terminal and type echo hello world. You’ll see the message hello world printed back.\n$ echo hello world\nhello world\n\n\n\nOne of the beautiful things about Unix command line is the ability to connect the output of one command as input as another one.\nWe’ve seen two command seq and figlet. Wouldn’t it be nice if we can print the numbers as large characters using figlet? For this we need to connect the output of seq to the input of figlet.\n$ seq 5 | figlet\n _\n/ |\n| |\n| |\n|_|\n\n ____\n|___ \\\n  __) |\n / __/\n|_____|\n\n _____\n|___ /\n  |_ \\\n ___) |\n|____/\n\n _  _\n| || |\n| || |_\n|__   _|\n   |_|\n\n ____\n| ___|\n|___ \\\n ___) |\n|____/\nThe | charater creates a pipeline connecting output of the first command to the input of the second command.\n\n\n\n\n\nnumbers.sh\n\nn=$1\nseq $n | figlet\n\nThe $1 is the first argument that is passed to the script.\nRemember that in a shell script, space around = are not accepted. So n=$1 is valid, but n = $1 is invalid. We’ll learn more about the nuances of shell scripts later.\nAnd you can run it using: bash numbers.sh\n$ bash numbers.sh 2\n _\n/ |\n| |\n| |\n|_|\n\n ____\n|___ \\\n  __) |\n / __/\n|_____|\n\n\n\n\nThe Unix Episode | Episode 32 of Everything is Everything\nThe Unix Shell - Software Carpentry\nVI Tutorial for Beginners - Tyler’s Guides",

The file not executable unless we explicitly make it so. Let’s look at the output of ls -l.\n$ ls -l hello-world.sh\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 anand anand 34 Aug 19 09:07 hello-world.sh\nThe first column of the output indicates that the file has read, and write permissions.\nWe do add execute permissions by running chmod.\n$ chmod +x hello-world.sh\n\n$ ls -l hello-world.sh\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 anand anand 34 Aug 19 09:07 hello-world.sh\nNow the file is exutable.

Everything after that character is considered a comment.\n\n\nhello-world.sh\n\n#! /bin/bash\n#\n# This program prints a hello world message\n#\n\necho \"Hello, world!\" # you can change the message here, if you wish\n\n# end of program\n\n\n\n\nVariables are placeholders to a value.

You may call it fcp-practice or programming-practice or something else.\nOnce the repository is created, clone it on to your computer.\n$ git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/&lt;repo-name&gt;\n\n$ cd &lt;repo-name&gt;\n\n\n\nRun command quarto create.\n$ quarto create\n ?

Once you save the file in vscode, the preview will also be updated.\n\n\n\nEdit the .gitignore file and add a new line _book/.
