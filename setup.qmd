# Software Setup

This page explains how to setup the coding environment for Ubuntu.

:::{.callout-note}
If you are have a computer running Windows, please follow instructions on [Installing Ubuntu on Windows using WSL](ubuntu-wsl.qmd) before moving further.
:::

## Install C compiler

For this course, we support only Ubuntu distribution of Linux. If you have any other distribution, please find out how to install GCC compiler.

Run the following commands to install C compiler and other build tools.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

## Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (vscode) is the recommended editor for this course. Please install it from [Visual Studio Code Downloads][2] page.

[2]: https://code.visualstudio.com/download


:::{.callout-warning}
If you are on Ubuntu 18.04, please install an older version by running the following commands.

```bash
wget https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.75.1/linux-deb-x64/stable
sudo dpkg -i code_1.75.1-1675893397_amd64.deb
```

## Install WSL extension in vscode

:::{.callout-warning}
You need to install WSL extension only if you are running Windows.
:::

Follow the following instructions to install the extension.

1. Open vscode and press `Ctrl+P`
2. Type `ext install ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl` and press Enter

## Make a directory for your code

It is recommended to create a new directory for all your programs in this course. Let's call it `computing`.

Open your terminal and run the following command.

```bash
mkdir computing
```

You can change the current directory to that using:

```bash
cd computing
```

## Download CSketch library

[CSketch][] is a library for drawing simple shapes in C programming language and it is required for this course.

Run the following command in your terminal to install it.

```bash
curl https://anandology.github.io/csketch/install.sh | bash
```

[CSketch]: https://anandology.github.io/csketch/

This will download the csketch library to your current directory and also adds a sample file `circle.c` and a `Makefile` to build your C code.

## Build your first program

Open your `computing` directory in vscode by running `code .` in your terminal.

```bash
$ code .
```

If you are on Windows, you should run this in Ubuntu running in WSL. The WSL Extension of vscode would have made the `code` command available in your environment.

Once the vscode is open, open a terminal from the menu `View -> Terminal`. You can also open the same using keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl + ` ``.

:::

In the terminal, run `make` to compile the `circle.c` file in the current directory.

```bash
$ make
gcc -I sketch -L sketch circle.c  -lm -l sketch -o circle
```

That compiled the `circle.c` and created executable file `circle`.

Run the `circle` program.

```bash
$ ./circle
```


That would have created a file `circle.svg`. Select the `circle.svg` file in the left sidebar to open it now press the _preview_ button.

Once you click preview, you'll be able to see the image in the right.
