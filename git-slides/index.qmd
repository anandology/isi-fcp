## Git vs. Github

**Git** is a version control system created by Linus Torvalds.

**Github** is a commercial service that offers git hosting in the cloud. It is very popular among the developers and it is almost the defacto standard for hosting code.

It is possible to use _Git_ without using _Github_. However, for this course, we'll use both _Git_ and _Github_.

## Setting up Git


Setup git by configuring your name and email address in git.

```text
$ git config --global user.name "Anand Chitipothu"
$ git config --global user.email "anand@example.com"
```

Please use your name and email address in the example above. Also, make sure the email address is same as what you have used when creating an account on github.

## Setup ssh-keys

```text
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C anand@my-laptop-name
```

That will output the following:

```text
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/anand/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```

Just press _Enter_.

```text
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```

If you are using your own laptop, leave this empty. If you using the lab computer, pick a strong passphrase as that allows pusing any changes to your repositories on github.
